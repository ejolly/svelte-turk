# Svelte Turk

ðŸš§ *Under active development!* ðŸš§

Svelte-Turk is a desktop application for interacting with [Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) service (e.g. creating HITs, contacting workers, getting HIT and Assignment meta-data etc). Designed to be a lightweight and simple tool for managing Mturk without the need to write any code, setup any servers, databases, etc. The goal of the project is to offer a modern graphical alternative to something like [PsiTurk](https://psiturk.org/).

*Svelte-Turk only handles nodes and connections highlighted in green, namely the creation and management of HITs via communication with MTurk and a local database. It's up to you to build your experiment or survey and store appropriate data as see you see fit. (figure made with [isoflow](https://isoflow.io/))*
