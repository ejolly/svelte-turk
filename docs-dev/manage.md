# Managing HITs

To help you manage your HITs, Svelte Turk renders a table of all HITs you've ever created on the Manage HITs page. A description of each column is provided below. 

*picture here*

| Field    |   Required    | Description |
| -------- | :-----------: | ----------: |
| col 1 is | left-aligned  |       $1600 |
| col 2 is |   centered    |         $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |          $1 |

## Deleting HITs

This button will delete HITs in Svelte Turk's local database *not* on Mturk itself. This is primarily useful for old HIT data you've already exported and you no longer want to see or for removing HITs you were trying out in [sandbox mode](modes.md)
