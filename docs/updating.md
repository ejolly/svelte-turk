# Updating SvelteTurk

> [!WARNING]
> Prior updating make sure that you're running SvelteTurk from your **/Applications** folder. If you're running SvelteTurk from your Desktop (i.e. you double-clicked on the icon on your Desktop), you may run into issues with the update never completing. If you do experience issues do the following:  
> 1. Move the SvelteTurk App to your /Applications folder  
> 2. Delete any other SvelteTurk files on your Desktop (including any folders and .zip files you downloaded from github)  
> 3. Open up the app and select the update option again

SvelteTurk will automatically check for updates on startup. You can also force checking for an update by reloading the window (`cmd+r`). Simply press the Download button to begin updating.

> [!NOTE]
> macOS may display a pop up the first time you try to update SvelteTurk asking for permission to your Desktop/Documents. Please accept this prompt so SvelteTurk can download a new version to your computer. SvelteTurk **does not** read any other documents or files on your computer.

When you accept SvelteTurk's update prompt it will download and unzip a new version to your Desktop. Just move this new version into your `/Applications` folder and confirm overwriting the previous version. **This will not overwrite any of your data!** Future versions of SvelteTurk will make it easier to auto-update the app, but [current restrictions](quickstart.md#unidentified-developer-warning) prevent this from happening.
