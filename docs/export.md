# Exporting SvelteTurk Data

At any point in time you can export all of SvelteTurk's data in JSON format using the Export Data button in the sidebar. Doing so will create the following files in a location of your choosing, named with todays data:

- `assts_{YYYY-MM-DD}.json` all Assignment data
- `hits_{YYYY-MM-DD}.json` all HIT data
- `workers_{YYYY-MM-DD}.json` all Worker data
- `hitTemplates_{YYYY-MM-DD}.json` all HIT templates you've saved
