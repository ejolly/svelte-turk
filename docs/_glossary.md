##### Assignment

Instances or "units" of each HIT that can be accepted and completed by a Worker and are paid for by a Requestor. This is also the unit that [Amazon uses for billing purposes](https://www.mturk.com/pricing). HITs with 9 or fewer Assignments are charged a 20% fee, while those with 10 or more are charged a 40% fee. Assignments are not visible to Workers.

##### Bonus

An additional payment (on top of a Reward), that you can pay a Worker for a particular Assignment.

##### HIT

Human-Intelligence-Task: the basic "job" that a Worker can do for a Reward and Bonus. When a Worker previews or accepts a HIT, they are previewing or accepting a single Assignment of that HIT.

##### HIT-Group

Multiple HITs with identical details. The number of HITs in the group determines the number of times a Worker can complete that task. HIT-Groups (with number of HITs available) are what Workers are being presented as they browse the Mturk marketplace.

##### Requestor

You, the entity creating HITs for Workers to complete in exchange for payment.

##### Reward

The payment a Requestor (you) makes to a Worker for completing an Assignment. Rewards are automatically paid to Workers after you *approve* an Assignment. Rewards [are not paid out](https://www.mturk.com/help#how_fees_cost_computed) for Assignments you *reject*.

##### Worker

Individual with an Amazon Mturk account who can complete your HIT in exchange for payment.
